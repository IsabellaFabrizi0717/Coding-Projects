# Coding-Projects
This is a compilation of various snippets of code that I have worked on in project teams.  

Propulsive Landing branch includes code from the University of Connecticut's chapter of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, specfically the Propulsive landing team.  This subteam is focused on replicating Falcon 9 rocket boosters on a model rocket scale.  I contributed to the Guidance navigation and Control/Software group for the project writing navigation and mode switch codes.
